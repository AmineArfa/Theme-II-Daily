Please remove the unwanted horizontal scrollbar appearing in the "Daily News" component on the homepage. The component is designed to show a list of articles, but it is currently overflowing its container, creating a bad user experience.

1. The Problem
A horizontal scrollbar is visible on the "Daily News" section, as shown in the attached screenshot. This happens because the container holding the article cards is wider than the viewport.

2. Technical Analysis
The issue originates from the combination of CSS Flexbox properties and white-space rules applied to the article list.

File to Edit: assets/css/screen.css

Problematic CSS Rule: Inside the .gh-topic-content class, the white-space: nowrap; property is preventing the article cards from wrapping to the next line. This, combined with the overflow-x: auto; on the same element, forces the scrollbar to appear.

3. Implementation Steps
To fix this, we need to adjust the CSS to allow the items to wrap naturally while hiding any minor overflow.

Instructions:

Navigate to the assets/css/screen.css file.

Locate the .gh-topic-content CSS selector.

Modify the properties as follows:

Change white-space: nowrap; to white-space: normal; to allow items to wrap.

Change overflow-x: auto; to overflow-x: hidden; to ensure no scrollbar appears if there's any residual overflow during rendering.

Here is the code to update:

CSS

/* Find this existing rule */
.gh-topic-content {
    display: flex;
    gap: 32px;
    margin: 0 -24px;
    padding: 4px 24px;
    overflow-x: auto; /* Change this */
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
    white-space: nowrap; /* And change this */
    -ms-overflow-style: none;
    scrollbar-width: none;
}

/* And change it to this: */
.gh-topic-content {
    display: flex;
    gap: 32px;
    margin: 0 -24px;
    padding: 4px 24px;
    overflow-x: hidden; /* UPDATED */
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
    white-space: normal; /* UPDATED */
    -ms-overflow-style: none;
    scrollbar-width: none;
}
This change will make the article cards wrap to the next line as intended and will completely remove the horizontal scrollbar.
